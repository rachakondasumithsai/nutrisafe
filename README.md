## About

An android app which provides nutritional information of general eatables, fitness calculators, health blogs, and calorie calculator. The target audience are students specifically undergraduate and graduate students who are looking for nutritional facts in their routine.

### Technologies and tools used:
* Android Studio 
* Kotlin 
* Java 
* JSON files for data storage
* MVC Architecture

## Why Nutrition?

If you want to lead a healthy lifestyle, then good nutrition is the key. In order to support your physical activities, you need to consume good nutritious food. With both above you can maintain rich and healthy lifestyle which promotes your health by reducing risks for chronic diseases.
#The Impact!
Do you know that the obesity is Also a progressive chronic disease? It is like all other chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Obesity in Canada is increasing significantly from past three years. The Canadian Community Health Survey has conducted surveys in 2014 and 2015 within Canada, resulting in 30% increase of obesity suffering adults, that is over 5 million adults area added which means one in three adults suffering from obesity [1].
There are several chronic diseases such as osteoporosis, heart diseases and cancer, which raises a health risk due to improper or poor diet consumption. In order to have a good and healthy dietary habit, you need to follow it from childhood itself.

By using our application, you can get to know the food item you want to consume with necessary nutrients your body needs to stay healthy and strong.

## Quality Assurance:
This is an awesome job where we get paid for cracking and breaking things. 
We learned how a software works and how it breaks. 
This is an important step to achieve perfect UX. 
At first, we thought we could do it after developing an application, but we came to know that this process is continuous and parallel with the development process and we adapted accordingly. 
With strong knowledge in topics such as SQL, software development, Java, software testing etc. we can achieve QA. 
We have performed QA for each step in the process. 
Testing is done in each milestone and each feature implementation individually. 
Again, testing is performed after integrating the features one after another and to the whole application. 
Sample test cases for manual testing are
* Case 1: Should accept decimal points when entering weight or height
* Case 2: Should get the search results even with one character but three characters are preferred
* Case 3: Should display information only after accepting required parameters while calculating BMI and BMR
* Case 3: Should accept only positive numbers
* Case 4: Should be able to search for items dynamically in add meal feature
* Case 5: Should be able to get a response in less than 0.5 second
* Case 6: Should be able to select multiple items and display exact calorie calculations.

## Usability:

We have learned Neilson’s Usability Heuristics in class and applied them on some examples. But we came to know the real meaning and the real usage after applying them on our project. These heuristics are widely used by usability professionals and UI designers. We can identify potential usability problems in the design stage with low cost and much more simplicity. We have asked some people to install the application and provide some feedback. Based on feedback we have applied Neilson’s Heuristics [2]-[4]
1.	Visibility of system status:
The users are clearly aware of what they are doing and where they are within the application. The response ratio is also fast enough for the user to provide seamless interaction. The tasks are also divided into much more simpler formats with warnings, error messages and solutions, such that to avoid confusing the user.
2.	Match between system and real world
The language used is the common English language with familiar terms where terms, phrases and concepts are matched to the real world. The images are also like real world images.
3.	User control and freedom
The users are in full control when using the application. Users can go back or abort any operation at any time. They can navigate back to any screen while using a specific feature. They can abort using a feature by just clicking the back button or anywhere on the navigation drawer in order to go to their desired functionality within a single click.
4.	Consistency and standards
The usage of language, visual elements, labels, symbols, colors and basic terms are maintained consistently by following standards such that it does not make a user go into a confusing state.
5.	Recognition rather than recall
Each object, action and option are made clearly visible by listing all the choices to the user whenever needed. For example, in the Addmeal feature we have provided a searchable spinner such that the user may search for an item or he may select from a dropdown list. We have ensured the navigation such that the user is never lost within the application. The user need not to remember anything but can identify any object by just looking at the option.
6.	Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
Error messages are always mentioned in plain text and familiar language along with possible solutions such that users can clearly understand it.
7.	Error prevention
Provided constraints where an error is possible such that to prevent the user from making an error. For example, while calculating BMI the age should be entered above 18.
8.	Flexibility and efficiency of use
The app is so flexible such that at any point of time a user can jump from one feature to another by just one click. Preloading of images and options are done to acquire efficiency.
9.	Aesthetic and minimalist design
This application is not only visually impressive but follows some conventions such that all the unnecessary data is hidden and shown when only needed. The needy information can be found easily without much effort. All the screens are designed in such a way that they are attractive, simple and clear of clutters.
10.	Help and documentation
This application can be used without documentation, but complete and clear help and documentation is provided so the user can access it within no time and understand the information provided.
